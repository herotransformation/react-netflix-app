# Netflix and Code

We want you to build a simple webpage that shows the hidden categories on Netflix, giving users the ability to search for a genre or category and then see the results.
 
You can find a list of the hidden categories here: <http://whatsonnetflix.com/netflix-hacks/the-netflix-id-bible-every-category-on-netflix/>
 
 
The objectives are as follows:
 
1. Devise a way to *programatically* get the content from the above blog link, and store it in a format that can be utilized by your frontend code. The page doesn't update often, so you shouldn't be concerned about storing stale data / keeping it fresh.
2. Build a UI that meets the criteria of functionality and looks pleasing. The app should do the following:
    1. List out all the Netflix categories.
    2. Click a category and it launches category info in a separate page or same page (<http://<app-url>/INSERTNUMBER>). The category info and list of other categories belong to that genre. 
    3. A user should be able to type in a search box and see the results filter immediately below.
 
## Rules

1. Donâ€™t use any CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see your hand written abilities.
2. Use React library. Allowed to use libraries if they are needed to get the job done.


## Submitting your code

Please host your code on a GitHub repository and provide us with a link to view the work.
_Bonus points_ if you deploy it to a static hosting service for us to view.
